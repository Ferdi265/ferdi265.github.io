~~So I'm currently trying to get this page up, and somehow I just don't get how I should do it.
The repo says the page is published, but if I visit the page, I get a 404. Hopefully it works if I wait 10 minutes...~~

It worked! I got it up! Seems the initial commit doesn't trigger a Jekyll build. Whatever, the site is up, and I'm happy :D
