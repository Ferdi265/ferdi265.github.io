Hello blog readers (probably only me, but whatever)!

It's really nice to have a personal DevBlog where I can dump all my unspoken thoughts about programming or projects I'm working on.

I'll post here whenever I feel like it or if I made progress on a major project, and I'm sure most (if not all) of my projects will get at least one blog post or even a suppage.

For now, I still need to configure a lot of this blog, so it may look ugly or completely break.
