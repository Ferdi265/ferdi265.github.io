To anyone wondering why the ppplz bot wasn't up the last half week: I'm moving to Ubuntu.

Getting a complete Ubuntu install going with all required packages, all my configs, and a working wine install with osu really takes some time. (Especially if you install it on a usb drive *sigh*).

But I got it working and should be able to get the bot up sometime tomorrow. :D
