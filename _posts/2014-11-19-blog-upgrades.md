The last few days I have been thinking about this blog, and what I could do to make it better. One of the first things I noticed was that my blog had next to no user interaction. Whoever was reading my blog was able to do just that: reading.

So when thinking about how other blogs handled this, I thought: "Why not use disqus?"

It took me quite a while to get it to work reliably but now it's done and I can actually use it pretty easily: I justh have to add ```comments: true``` in the front-matter or use the ```post``` layout.

That said, I don't think that I have anything interesting to write any more, so I guess I'll leave it at that.

```sh
exit 0
```
