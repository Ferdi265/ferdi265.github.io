I'm Ferdinand "Ferdi265" Bachmann, and I really like programming, especially node.js.

# Why this blog?

I just need somewhere to dump all the completely irrelevant details of all my current projects that pobably noone will ever really use. I also want to have somewhere to actually show off my completed projects.
